## Abstract

This document presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures for short-term weather prediction using historical meteorological data from Bangladesh spanning 1990-2023.

Through systematic experimentation involving advanced feature engineering, time series cross-validation, and statistical significance testing, we demonstrate that LSTM networks achieve superior performance with an RMSE of 2.847°C and 68.4% accuracy within ±2°C tolerance.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

Weather prediction represents one of the most challenging applications in time series forecasting due to the complex, non-linear relationships between meteorological variables and their temporal dependencies. Traditional numerical weather prediction models, while sophisticated, often require substantial computational resources and may struggle with short-term local forecasting accuracy. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), offer promising alternatives for capturing temporal patterns in meteorological data.

The Bangladesh meteorological context presents unique challenges due to the country's tropical monsoon climate, characterized by distinct seasonal patterns, high humidity, and significant precipitation variability. Accurate short-term weather forecasting is crucial for agricultural planning, disaster preparedness, and daily life management in this densely populated region.

### 1.2 Research Objectives

1. **Architecture Comparison**: Which RNN architecture (SimpleRNN, LSTM, or GRU) provides optimal performance for Bangladesh weather prediction?
2. **Feature Engineering Impact**: How does comprehensive feature engineering affect model performance and temporal pattern recognition?
3. **Statistical Validation**: Are performance differences between architectures statistically significant and practically meaningful?
4. **Production Viability**: Can these models be deployed in production environments with adequate monitoring and reliability?

### 1.3 Contributions

This research makes several significant contributions to the field of meteorological forecasting:

- **Empirical Architecture Comparison**: Systematic evaluation of three RNN variants on real-world weather data
- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Development of 50+ temporal and statistical features from basic meteorological observations

(2020) showed that LSTM networks could outperform traditional autoregressive models for precipitation prediction, while Zhang et al. (2019) demonstrated the utility of GRU networks for temperature forecasting in complex terrain regions.

### 2.2 RNN Architecture Comparison

The comparative evaluation of RNN architectures for time series prediction has been extensively studied across various domains. Greff et al. (2017) provided comprehensive analysis of LSTM variants, while Chung et al. (2014) demonstrated that GRU networks could achieve comparable performance to LSTMs with reduced computational complexity.

### 2.3 Feature Engineering for Meteorological Data

Effective feature engineering plays a crucial role in weather prediction models. Kumar et al. (2021) emphasized the importance of temporal encoding and lag features, while Rodriguez et al. (2020) demonstrated the value of cyclical transformations for seasonal pattern recognition.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Dataset Description

The study utilizes a comprehensive weather dataset from Bangladesh covering the period 1990-2023, providing 33+ years of daily meteorological observations. The dataset includes:

- **Temporal Coverage**: 12,053 daily observations
- **Geographic Scope**: Bangladesh national weather station data
- **Variables**: Wind Speed, Specific Humidity, Relative Humidity, Precipitation, Temperature
- **Target Variable**: Daily temperature (°C)
- **Data Quality**: Minimal missing values (<0.1%) with consistent measurement protocols

### 3.2 Data Preprocessing Pipeline

#### 3.2.1 Temporal Index Construction

The preprocessing pipeline transforms the original Year/Day-of-year format into proper datetime indexing, enabling chronological analysis and proper time series operations. This transformation is critical for maintaining temporal integrity throughout the analysis.

#### 3.2.2 Feature Engineering Strategy

The feature engineering process expands the original 5 meteorological variables into 50+ comprehensive features:

**Temporal Features:**

- Day of Year (1-365/366)
- Month indicators (1-12)
- Seasonal classifications (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn)

**Cyclical Encoding:**

- Sine/cosine transformations for temporal variables
- Preserves cyclical nature of calendar patterns

**Moving Averages:**

- 7-day and 30-day rolling means
- Trend identification and noise reduction

**Lag Features:**

- Historical values at 1, 2, 3, 7, and 30-day intervals
- Captures weather persistence and autocorrelation

**Rate of Change Features:**

- First-order differences for trend analysis
- Weekly change indicators for pattern shifts

**Statistical Features:**

- Rolling standard deviations and extremes
- Weather variability quantification

#### 3.2.3 Normalization and Scaling

All features undergo MinMaxScaler normalization (0-1 range) to ensure:

- Gradient stability during training
- Equal feature contribution to learning
- Optimal activation function performance

Critical attention is paid to preventing data leakage by fitting scalers exclusively on training data.

### 3.3 Time Series Splitting Strategy

The study implements temporal splitting to simulate realistic forecasting scenarios:

- **Validation Set (20%)**: 2013-2019 (middle period)
- **Test Set (10%)**: 2019-2023 (most recent data)

This approach prevents information leakage and ensures models generalize to future time periods.

### 3.4 Sequence Generation for RNN Training

Weather sequences are generated using a sliding window approach:

- **Sequence Length**: 30 days (optimal for monthly pattern capture)
- **Prediction Horizon**: 1 day ahead (practical forecasting window)
- **Input Dimensions**: (batch_size, 30, 50+) representing timesteps and features
- **Output Dimensions**: (batch_size, 1) for temperature prediction
